Generative AI with Large Language Models

# Lab 1 - Generative AI Use Case: Summarize Dialogue
* In this lab, we will do the dialogue summarization task using generative AI. We will explore how the input text affects the output of the model, and perform prompt engineering to direct it towards the task you need. By comparing zero shot, one shot, and few shot inferences, we will take the first step towards prompt engineering and see how it can enhance the generative output of Large Language Models. 

# Lab 2 - Fine-Tune a Generative AI Model for Dialogue Summarization
* In this lab, we will fine-tune an existing LLM from Hugging Face for enhanced dialogue summarization. We will use the FLAN-T5 model, which provides a high quality instruction tuned model and can summarize text out of the box. To improve the inferences, you will explore a full fine-tuning approach and evaluate the results with ROUGE metrics. Then we will perform Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), evaluate the resulting model and see that the benefits of PEFT outweigh the slightly-lower performance metrics.
